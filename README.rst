A collection of Django performance monitoring utilities

The goal is to have a simple way to collect common performance data which can
be reused across various Django-related testing and tuning tools such as
django-crawler (http://github.com/ericholscher/django-crawler). The performance-tools-refactor
branch supports memory and query counting with CSV export for CI tools:
